# Trained neural network architecture search model for the particle thermal radiation in dense particulate systems

The trained model is re-written as the MATLAB script. 

Using MATLAB or GNU Octave, anyone can reproduce the results for the view factor between spheres under various conditions.

For 2-sphere case, 

run following command in command windows:


F2([0 0 0 2 0 0])

First particle position is [0 0 0 ], Second one at [2 0 0].The output of X12 is:

0.0756
